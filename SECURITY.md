# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue in AppHub, please report it privately so we can address it quickly.

1. Open a private security advisory via the **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability** flow on GitHub. This will notify the maintainers without publicly disclosing the issue.
2. If GitHub advisories are unavailable, email [security@apphub.dev](mailto:security@apphub.dev) with the details, reproduction steps, and any suggested fixes.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and provide updates until the issue is resolved.

## Supported Versions
AppHub is under active development; only the `main` branch receives security updates. Please keep your deployment in sync with `main` and apply patches promptly.
