# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We want everyone participating in the AppHub project to feel welcome, respected, and safe. We pledge to act and interact in ways that foster an open, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and apologizing to those affected
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at [conduct@apphub.dev](mailto:conduct@apphub.dev). All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly.

Maintainers must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** — subtle warning for behavior that violates the Code.
2. **Warning** — explicit warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban** — temporary ban from interaction for repeated or serious violations.
4. **Permanent Ban** — permanent ban for extreme circumstances or repeated violations.
