# Ticket 016: Modularize Catalog Fastify Server

## Summary
Refactor the monolithic `services/catalog/src/server.ts` file into domain-scoped Fastify plugins so the API surface is easier to maintain, test, and extend.

## Problem Statement
The catalog service currently declares authentication, repositories, builds, services, jobs, workflows, AI helpers, and bundle publishing routes inside a single 3,900+ line `server.ts` file. Shared schemas are duplicated inline, operator guard logic is scattered, and the fileâ€™s size makes incremental changes risky. Breaking the server into domain modules with reusable schema packages will reduce coupling, improve readability, and unlock targeted testing for each area.

## Goals & Scope
- Define domain plugins (e.g., `routes/repositories.ts`, `routes/workflows.ts`, `routes/jobs.ts`, `routes/services.ts`, `routes/auth.ts`) that register related routes and reuse shared helpers.
- Extract Zod schema definitions and TypeScript types into per-domain modules or a shared `schemas/` package to eliminate inline duplication.
- Introduce a lightweight registration layer in `server.ts` that composes the domain plugins and wires common hooks (auth, logging, error handling).
- Ensure existing REST and WebSocket endpoints retain parity, including validation, error responses, and telemetry hooks.
- Delete redundant operator-scope guards or schema copies after the shared modules are adopted.
- Update documentation and runbooks to describe the new module layout and contribution guidelines.

## Non-Goals
- Changing public API contracts or adding new endpoints beyond necessary refactor-driven adjustments.
- Rewriting queue workers or ingestion logic (covered by separate tickets).
- Migrating to a different web framework; Fastify remains the server choice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `server.ts` shrinks to a thin bootstrap that registers domain plugins and shared middleware in fewer than 500 lines.
- Each domain plugin encapsulates its routes, schemas, and handlers with clear exports and unit-testable functions.
- Shared Zod schemas/types are imported from the new modules; duplicated schema definitions in `server.ts` are removed.
- Operator scope checks are centralized (e.g., helper `requireScopes`) and reused across plugins without local inline copies.
- API regression tests or integration smoke tests confirm that existing endpoints behave identically post-refactor.
- Documentation/runbooks are updated to explain where to add new routes and schemas.

## Implementation Notes
- Start by identifying cohesive route clusters (repositories, workflows, jobs) and extracting them one at a time to keep diffs reviewable.
- Create helper utilities for registering auth hooks and error formatters so plugins can opt into common behavior with minimal boilerplate.
- Consider adding a `plugins/index.ts` barrel file to simplify registration order and avoid circular dependencies.
- Update existing unit/integration tests to import the new module paths; add focused tests per plugin to cover edge cases previously only tested indirectly.
- Ensure Hot Module Replacement or dev server reload paths remain functional after the file structure changes.

## Dependencies
- Existing Fastify server configuration, authentication utilities, and database access modules.
- Test harnesses and fixtures that exercise the catalog API endpoints.
- Documentation tooling for updating runbooks.

## Testing Notes
- Run existing API integration and end-to-end tests to ensure behavior parity after modularization.
- Add unit tests for newly extracted schema helpers and route handlers where feasible.
- Perform manual smoke tests against key operator flows (repository ingest, workflow launch) in a dev environment.

## Deliverables
- Refactored catalog server codebase with domain plugins and shared schema modules.
- Updated documentation/runbooks reflecting the modular structure and contribution patterns.
- Test evidence (CI runs, logs) demonstrating parity and coverage of the refactored server.
