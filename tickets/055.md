# Ticket 055 â€“ Scoped Filestore Event Streaming

## Summary
Allow clients to filter filestore SSE traffic by mount, path prefix, and event types, and teach the explorer to subscribe selectively to reduce unnecessary refreshes.

## Motivation
The current stream broadcasts every event to every subscriber, forcing the UI to filter client-side and refetch broadly. Selective subscriptions will lower load and improve responsiveness on large deployments.

## Scope
- Backend:
  - Extend `/v1/events/stream` to accept query params (`backendMountId`, `pathPrefix`, `events[]`).
  - Perform server-side filtering before emitting frames; ensure heartbeat and inline/Redis modes respect filters.
  - Add rate limiting/backpressure handling for chatty mounts.
- Frontend:
  - Pass active mount/path filters when subscribing; auto-resubscribe when filters change.
  - Reduce polling cadence when targeted SSE events are available.
  - Update activity feed controls to toggle event categories on/off.

## Acceptance Criteria
- SSE stream delivers only requested events; verified via integration tests.
- UI stops triggering unnecessary list/node refetches when irrelevant events arrive.
- Documentation updated in `services/filestore/README.md` and frontend README.

## Dependencies / Notes
- Ensure Redis pub/sub backplane respects filter context; may require embedding filters in subscription channels or in-process filtering.
- Validate compatibility with inline (test) mode.
