# Ticket 005: Security, Observability & Rollout Hardening

## Summary
Finalize the jobs and workflows platform with enterprise-grade security controls, observability integrations, and a staged rollout plan.

## Problem Statement
After implementing orchestration and UX, the platform still needs rigorous auth, secret handling, alerting, and deployment safeguards before production rollout. This ticket consolidates the hardening tasks required for operational readiness.

## Scope & Requirements
- Enforce authentication/authorization for job/workflow registration and manual execution endpoints, integrating with existing user/service token mechanisms.
- Implement secret management hooks for job and service steps (pulling runtime credentials from the chosen secret store) and audit access.
- Expand observability: structured logs routed to aggregation service, metrics exported for run counts/durations/failure rates, and alerting hooks (webhooks/PagerDuty) when workflows fail repeatedly.
- Document rollback strategies and migration/versioning flows for workflow definitions across environments (dev/stage/prod).
- Define and execute a phased rollout plan including canary testing, monitoring dashboards, and SLA commitments.

## Non-Goals
- Redesigning the orchestrator core logic (only hardening).
- Introducing new workflow features beyond security/observability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AuthZ checks prevent unauthorized job/workflow creation and manual execution attempts, with audit logs capturing who initiated actions.
- Secrets required by steps are fetched securely at runtime without persisting plaintext in databases or logs.
- Metrics and alerts integrate with existing monitoring stacks and fire on defined thresholds.
- Documentation includes rollout checklist, rollback steps, and guidance for migrating workflow definitions between environments.

## Dependencies
- Tickets 001â€“004 to provide full functionality and UX for jobs/workflows.

## Testing Notes
- Add security-focused tests (unit/integration) verifying permission enforcement and secret access patterns.
- Run load tests or simulations to validate monitoring/alert triggers.
