# Ticket 047: Timestore Dataset Access Audit API

## Problem Statement
Timestore records ingest and query events in `dataset_access_audit`, but there is no API surface or UI that exposes the history. Operators currently have to query Postgres directly to understand who attempted an ingest, which scopes were missing, or when the last successful query occurred.

## Goals
- Expose paginated admin routes to list dataset access audit records with filters for action type, success state, and time range.
- Ensure responses include actor identifiers, scopes, metadata (stage, error, jobId, manifestId), and timestamps for observability.
- Provide shared typings so the frontend can render audit timelines without guesswork.

## Non-Goals
- Building a long-term analytics store for audit data; continue to rely on the timestore Postgres schema.
- Redesigning the audit event schemaâ€”the current structure is adequate for surfacing logs.

## Implementation Sketch
1. Add `/admin/datasets/:datasetId/audit` routes that validate query params (limit, cursor, filters) and read from `listDatasetAccessEvents` with new helper filters.
2. Extend the metadata repository with filterable queries (e.g., by action, success, time bounds) and ensure indexes support the access patterns.
3. Return results sorted by `created_at` and include cursor metadata for pagination; document the format in the API reference.
4. Cover the new endpoints with unit/integration tests, including authorization failures (`timestore:admin` scope required) and filter handling.
5. Update shared packages so UI can import the request/response schemas.

## Deliverables
- New admin API for dataset access audit retrieval with filtering and pagination support.
- Repository helpers and database indexes enabling efficient audit queries.
- Automated tests validating authorization, filtering, and pagination behavior.
- Updated documentation describing how to fetch and interpret audit logs.
