# Ticket 097: Topology Explorer QA & Rollout

## Problem Statement
Before launching the workflow topology explorer, we must validate functionality across the stack, ensure performance and accessibility targets are met, and plan a controlled rollout. Skipping coordinated QA risks regressions in existing catalog tooling and a poor operator experience.

## Goals
- Execute end-to-end QA covering backend graph assembly, API responses, frontend rendering, interactions, and live updates.
- Profile performance (frontend render time, backend response latency, cache hit rates) and document baselines plus remediation steps.
- Validate accessibility (keyboard paths, screen reader output, color contrast) and address gaps.
- Define a rollout plan with feature flagging, staged enablement, documentation updates, and support handoff.

## Non-Goals
- Building new features or UX beyond polishing issues uncovered during QA.
- Expanding telemetry beyond what is necessary for launch monitoring.
- Post-launch analytics dashboards (tracked separately).

## Implementation Sketch
1. Draft a QA checklist referencing Tickets 090â€“096 deliverables; run through manual/automated tests across browsers and dataset sizes.
2. Capture performance metrics using Lighthouse/Profiler and server logs; file follow-up actions for any regressions.
3. Conduct an accessibility audit with internal and external tools; fix critical issues before enabling GA.
4. Prepare user-facing documentation (operator runbooks, release notes) and coordinate enablement with ops/support.
5. Implement feature flags or configuration toggles for staged rollout; plan monitoring/alerting for early adopters.

## Deliverables
- Completed QA checklist with issue tracking and resolutions.
- Performance + accessibility reports archived in `docs/workflow-topology/`.
- Release notes, runbook updates, and rollout checklist ready for launch approval.
