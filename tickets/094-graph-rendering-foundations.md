# Ticket 094: Workflow Graph Rendering Foundations

## Problem Statement
A polished topology explorer requires a modern, customizable visualization layer beyond basic Graphviz output. We need to select and integrate a graph rendering library that supports interactivity, theming, performant layouts, and responsive design within our React frontend.

## Goals
- Evaluate candidate libraries (e.g., Cytoscape.js, visx + DAG componentry, Reaflow) against requirements from Ticket 090 and choose one that balances power, customization, and bundle size.
- Establish a reusable graph rendering component with theming hooks, layout configuration, and integration with our design system tokens.
- Ensure responsive behavior, zoom/pan controls, and virtualized rendering to handle large graphs.
- Provide performance benchmarks on representative datasets and document tuning knobs.

## Non-Goals
- Implement final UX polish such as tooltips, filtering, or click-through navigation (Ticket 095).
- Overlay live status or streaming data (Ticket 096).
- Ship experimental libraries without due diligence on licensing/support.

## Implementation Sketch
1. Run a spike comparing shortlisted libraries using sample graph data; capture findings in a decision record.
2. Implement a foundational `WorkflowGraphCanvas` component that:
   - Accepts normalized nodes/edges.
   - Applies consistent styling (colors, typography) from the design system.
   - Exposes layout configuration props.
3. Add unit and visual regression tests (Storybook stories) covering small, medium, and large graphs.
4. Profile interaction performance (zoom, pan, layout recomputation) and document limits plus mitigation strategies.

## Deliverables
- Decision record documenting the chosen visualization stack.
- Reusable graph rendering component with theming/layout controls and tests.
- Performance benchmarks and guidance for designers/developers.
