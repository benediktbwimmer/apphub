# Ticket 115: Validate Docker Runtime End-to-End and Plan Rollout

## Problem
After implementing schema, runner, and observability work, we still need confidence that Docker jobs execute reliably across environments. Without dedicated integration tests, staging validation, and a rollout checklist, we risk shipping an incomplete feature to production tenants.

## Proposal
- Build an end-to-end test harness that provisions a sample Docker job, stages synthetic Filestore inputs, executes the container, and verifies uploaded outputs plus telemetry.
- Automate test execution in CI where Docker is available; skip with clear messaging otherwise.
- Define a rollout plan: enable feature flag in staging, run smoke tests, document operator steps (Docker socket permissions, filestore credentials), and schedule production enablement per tenant.
- Capture manual validation steps in runbooks, including cleanup commands and troubleshooting tips.
- Record metrics during pilot rollout to monitor failure rates and performance regressions.

## Deliverables
- Integration tests (potentially under `tests/` or service-specific suites) covering the full Docker job lifecycle with mocked/stubbed external dependencies where needed.
- CI pipeline updates to run Docker-enabled tests and publish artifacts/logs for debugging.
- A rollout checklist in `docs/runbooks/docker-jobs-rollout.md` with success criteria and rollback steps.
- Post-rollout monitoring dashboard or alerts tied to Docker job metrics.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Limited CI Docker support:** Detect environment capabilities and provide local scripts to run the suite when CI cannot.
- **Flaky tests:** Use deterministic sample images and avoid reliance on external registries by building/publishing fixtures during the pipeline.
- **Rollout surprises:** Engage ops early, document prerequisites, and stage feature flag enablement to a small cohort before broad release.
