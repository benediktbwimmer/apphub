# Ticket 090: Workflow Topology Requirements Alignment

## Problem Statement
We plan to surface an end-to-end workflow topology explorer spanning event triggers, schedules, assets, and runtime state. Before touching code, we need a shared understanding of the experience, data contract, performance guardrails, accessibility expectations, and adoption risks. Without this alignment, downstream backend/frontend work could diverge or miss stakeholder needs.

## Goals
- Facilitate a working session across catalog, frontend, design, and ops to define the graph viewer’s primary jobs-to-be-done.
- Capture interaction requirements (navigation, filtering, live status), accessibility targets, and non-functional constraints (latency, dataset size).
- Produce a versioned graph data contract describing node/edge types, metadata payloads, and update semantics for live overlays.
- Document identified risks, dependencies, phased rollout strategy, and ownership for subsequent tickets.

## Non-Goals
- Implement any backend or frontend code.
- Decide on a specific visualization library implementation (that happens later once constraints are clear).
- Finalize visual styling beyond high-level design direction.

## Implementation Sketch
1. Schedule and run a cross-team workshop; gather prior art (existing workflow timeline, asset explorer) for reference.
2. Draft a collaboration doc outlining user journeys, required data fields, expected event volume, and accessibility needs; iterate with stakeholders.
3. Translate the agreed requirements into a structured graph schema proposal (node types, edge directionality, metadata shapes, update cadence).
4. File follow-up actions, risks, and open questions; secure sign-off from product/design/ops leads.

## Deliverables
- Workshop notes and recorded decisions stored in `docs/workflow-topology/` (new directory if needed).
- Approved graph data contract draft checked into the repository.
- Updated project plan referencing downstream tickets 091–097 with named owners and timelines.
