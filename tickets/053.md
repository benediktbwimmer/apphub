# Ticket 053 â€“ Filestore Explorer Write Workflows

## Summary
Implement create/upload/move/copy/delete actions directly in the explorer UI, backed by existing filestore command endpoints, with idempotency and validation feedback.

## Motivation
Operators must rely on CLI commands for mutations despite the explorer already listing nodes. Embedding write flows reduces context switching and highlights command results in real time.

## Scope
- UI forms:
  - Directory creation modal with path validation and metadata editor.
  - File upload dialog supporting drag/drop, overwrite toggle, checksum optional input, and progress.
  - Move/copy wizards with path pickers and overwrite confirmation.
  - Soft-delete controls with recursive toggle and safety prompts.
- Leverage `@apphub/frontend` toast hooks and existing API helpers, emitting `filestore.command.completed` events to the activity feed.
- Reflect pending state in list/detail panes while commands run; auto-select affected nodes on success.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All new actions respect scope checks (`filestore:write` or admin) and block read-only identities.
- Idempotency keys generated per action; retries surface clear messaging.
- Vitest coverage for form state reducers and API integration; visual regression coverage with Storybook stories if available.

## Dependencies / Notes
- Coordinate with design for modal layouts and destructive action copy.
- Ensure large uploads do not block the main thread (use streaming `fetch`).
