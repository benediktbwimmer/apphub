# Ticket 051 â€“ Surface Backend Mount Directory Metadata

## Summary
Introduce mount listing/CRUD capabilities in the filestore service and update the explorer UI to present human-friendly mount metadata instead of raw numeric ids.

## Motivation
Operators currently type mount ids manually because the API does not expose mount descriptors. This slows triage and increases user error. Listing mounts with names, kinds, and access state unlocks richer navigation and makes the UI self-service.

## Scope
- Backend:
  - Add `GET /v1/backend-mounts` with pagination and filters.
  - Add `GET /v1/backend-mounts/:id` and optional create/update routes guarded by `filestore:admin`.
  - Reuse existing `backend_mounts` table; expose relevant fields and state transitions.
- Frontend:
  - Fetch mounts on load and populate a select menu with `name`, `kind`, and `state` badges.
  - Display mount details (root path, bucket/prefix, access mode) in a side panel.
  - Handle disabled/offline mounts gracefully, guiding users to remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Mount list endpoint returns data within 200ms for 1k mounts; fields validated via shared zod schema.
- UI defaults to the first active mount but allows search/filter; numeric text input is removed.
- Tests cover error handling when the list cannot be fetched.

## Dependencies / Notes
- Coordinate with metastore owners if shared types live in `@apphub/shared`.
- Consider caching mount metadata client side while respecting admin updates.
