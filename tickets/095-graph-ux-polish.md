# Ticket 095: Workflow Graph UX & Interaction Polish

## Problem Statement
Once the graph canvas exists, we must deliver the rich interactions operators expect: semantic highlighting, drill-down navigation, filtering, and accessible controls. Without these UX layers the visualization remains a static diagram that fails to support investigation workflows.

## Goals
- Implement zoom/pan controls, keyboard navigation, and focus management that meet accessibility standards.
- Add context-rich interactions: hover tooltips, node details panel, click-through links to workflow definition/run/asset views, and badges for triggers/schedules.
- Provide search and filter controls (by workflow, asset, event type) with instant feedback.
- Align visuals with design specs: color palette, iconography, typography, and empty/error states.

## Non-Goals
- Live status overlays (Ticket 096).
- Changes to backend data contract.
- Comprehensive analytics instrumentation (can follow in a later iteration if needed).

## Implementation Sketch
1. Extend `WorkflowGraphCanvas` with interaction handlers, focus rings, and ARIA labeling; ensure compatibility with screen readers.
2. Build ancillary UI components: filter bar, legend/status badges, details side panel wired to the data store.
3. Integrate navigation actions linking to existing workflow/asset pages, preserving routing and state.
4. Collaborate with design to validate visual polish; capture adjustments in Storybook and snapshot tests.
5. Write integration tests (Playwright) covering critical interaction flows.

## Deliverables
- Enhanced graph UI with accessible controls, filters, and detail views.
- Updated design system tokens/components as needed.
- Automated tests plus documentation/screenshots for reviewers.
